Of course, when mastering a foreign language requires a good memory, logical thinking. 
However, knowing the language, reading and speaking in a foreign language is a feasible task. 
It is only necessary to approach this issue with all seriousness.

learn languages quickly and easily. Successfully studying a foreign language and in adolescence. 
This means that the earlier a person begins to learn a language, the better he will achieve.
